Project: Automated Factory Farm Objection Generator (AFFOG)
AFFOG is an AI-powered civic-tech platform that enables citizens, NGOs, and legal advocates to
automatically generate legally grounded objections, complaints, and RTI-style submissions against factory
farming operations, slaughterhouses, and animal welfare violations. The prototype allows users to input a
location, violation type, and jurisdiction. The system retrieves relevant animal welfare laws, environmental
regulations, and precedent cases, then generates structured, jurisdiction-specific objection documents
ready for submission to authorities. Current MVP includes document generation, basic jurisdiction
mapping, and NGO-focused workflows. The tool significantly reduces the time and expertise required to
initiate formal objections, enabling scalable animal advocacy.
Selected Participant(s):
Abid Khan — Project Lead
The above-named participant(s) were selected through a competitive application process on the
basis of the technical merit, feasibility, and potential impact of their proposed project. Their
participation in AARC requires full-time, in-person attendance in Bengaluru for the duration of the
programme.
